# SoundSynthetizerHTML
This is an application which original idea originates from a hackaton. The goal is to be able to build our modular synthetizer using
a GUI and chaining different Audio-node. This project is purely recreative, for my own curiosity.

If you are curious, you can play with the built version here: https://francoisgergaud.github.io/SoundSynthetizerHTML/


## Development
This application is a client application (no server, no network access except the application resources itself), running in the Browser using HTML5 Audio-nodes. It is developed in VueJS and Typescript.

To start a local server for development:
`npm run dev`
